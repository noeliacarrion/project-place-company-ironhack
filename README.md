The repository contains the following files:
  - Folder "out" with the databases(after cleaned and after geoqueries) and the maps
  - 2 Jupyter notebook with de code. The first one contains all the data cleaning, the other one the geoquery and the request to Google API
  
### Requeriments

- First of all, it's important to stay near to other tech new companies, so i've categorized the type of each company.

- My first decition was to select companies which were founded beetween 2009 and 2019 but the database contained values to 2013, so if've modified the requirements and select companies from 2007.

- I was looking for locationes where the total money raised was at least 1 million. 

- To expand the gaming industry i've decided to find locations out USA and see what kind of companies there are in other countries.

- It's important too the satisfaction's employees and the 30% have at least 1 childes. I've used Google API to find close to the radius schools or kindergarten
